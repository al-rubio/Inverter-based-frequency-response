\subsection{Analysis of Critical Time}


When the simplified and the extended models of the IEEE benchmark are compared for the estimation of the critical time, it is noticed a higher deviation in the low range of RoCoF. This due to the fact that in this range of RoCoF the critical time is long enough to allow the governor response activation of the respective synchronous machines representation. Therefore it can be stated that the simplifications made in the model have a greater influence on the results for low values of penetration of IBG and low power imbalances; in this sense, the simplifications become less significant as the RoCoF increases in such a manner that the activated synchronous primary reserve is not relevant in frequency support.In the range of higher values of RoCoF than 2 Hz/s, the critical time trend for the European grid-scale and the simplified IEEE model get closer each other as RoCoF increases.\\

Therefore under high RoCoF conditions in any of the models, the primary reserve does not significantly counteract the frequency drop [16]. Figure 5 1 demonstrates that primary reserve can be neglected for determining the critical time when the combination of IBG and load imbalances would lead to high values of RoCoF; as RoCoF increases, the approximation of critical time as 1Hz/RoCoF narrows the difference with the results obtained from simulations [14].Nevertheless, such simplification applies to the simplified IEEE model and the European island. Hence, the influence of all the dynamics and machine components, such as
generator exciter and damping windings, seems to improve the critical time. Damping torque in equation [7, 8] was not considered for the IEEE simplified model; the inclusion of such may lead to more precise times when compared with the extended model.\\

%Also it is then stated the need of a fast power response to avoid frequency collapse of islanded micro-grid or an electric island in the European scale.% Even assuming that power reserve can
%immediately fully activated after RoCoF reading, the 100 ms limitation is a constraint for high unbalanced islands with high penetration of IBG in the European case as demonstrated in the result section.

% As conclusion

%Additionally, the direct measurement of RoCoF in the 100 ms interval can lead to misleading readings [14]. In general, when penetration
%of IBG is higher than 90\%; for the 40\% imbalance an activation time between 30 and 50 ms would be needed to keep frequency within the allowed limits.
Due to the fact that the characteristics of the  European interconnected scenario provided by ENTSOE were assumed to be the same than the resulting islands after a severe event; the results for the large scale model can be understood as the behavior of the whole European system with bigger perturbations. The dimensioning scenario assumes a power imbalance of 3 GW, which corresponds to a 2\% of the 150 GW load [1]. If in future a bigger dimensioning case is utilized, then synchronous response would not be enough to balance the system before load shedding occurs. Table 5 1 exhibits the required time when the dimensioning scenario is increased up to 10\% for different IBG penetration.



\subsection{Analysis of Synthetic Inertia and Fast Power Reserve}

\subsubsection{Effect Synthetic Inertia on Frequency}

In this section are presented the results of the simulations carried out in the simplified IEEE model and the European model with the implementation of synthetic inertia control to the wind share of the IBG. The frequency nadir for such systems without any additional power support apart from synchronous response are illustrated in figures XXX and XXX. \\



Insert the figures here of no SI support\\

this as caption For the acceleration constant corresponding to the 80\% of the IBG, the frequency nadir reaches values lower than 49 Hz with power imbalances starting at $ \sim 7\% $.
this as caption At 80\% of IBG, frequecy nadir reaches 48.73 Hz with only $\sim 3\% $ of imbalance. \\


Insert figures with synthetic inertia here.
\\
In any of the cases UFLS is not avoided for all combination of variables (imbalance and acceleration constant). It can also be observed that frequency nadir under 49 Hz are reached for imbalances bigger than 14\% combined with shares of IBG above 80\%. simplified.

In the same manner than fig, in fig XXX the synthetic inertia is not enough for withstanding severe imbalances under high penetration of inverter based generators. At 80\% of IBG, the frequecy nadir reaches 48.89 Hz with an imbalance of 3\%. 

An enhanced performance is achieved in the simplified IEEE model as depicted in FIGIRE XXX. The reason behind this, is the faster response of the synchronous share present in the system, which jointly performs with the synthetic inertia to improve over all frequency response performance. In Figure XXX can be observed how power is deployed in a few seconds in the simplified IEEE model whereas in the European model the response is always limited to fully deployment in the order of $ \sim 30 $s.

Insert figure of the power response and freq response over time

Figure 4 9 and Figure 4 10 indicate the frequency response obtained of the system with an non-synchronous generation of 80\% for different load imbalances.  
In Figure 4 9 can be observed how the frequency drops below 49 Hz with a 10\% of imbalance, when no IBFPR or synthetic inertia is used as frequency support estrategy. In the same figure, the frequency responses for different levels of synthetic inertia is presented. 

It is noticed the improvement in FIG XXX in the response with the implementation of synthetic inertia with each contribution of wind energy to the non-synchronous generation. UFLS is avoided for every share of synthetic inertia, assuming that primary reserve takes place after SI. As the imbalance increases, the effectiveness of the synthetic inertia decreases, depending on the contribution of wind power to the inverter based generation. Figure 4 10 shows how a contribution of wind power of 40\% from the inverter based generation is capable of avoiding UFLS. Nevertheless the share of 80\% begins with a low rate of frequency decrement, the frequency sudenly drops below 49 Hz. This is due to the high amount of synthetic inertial power when compared to the load imbalance. This situation leads to UFLS after the 10 s because frequency has been sustained during that time by the synthetic inertial power. Since 10 seconds is the assumed time limit for exceeding nominal turbine power rate; the synthetic inertial power, which has a big contribution to counteract the power imbalance, is switched off as depicted in Figure 4 11. On the other hand, when a higher imbalance occurs and the synthetic inertial response is saturated, due to the limitation of 10\% of rated power, the mechanical power increases at 10 seconds, having a less severe impact the switching off of the inertial response.



\subsubsection{Effect of Power Ramp Response on Frequency}

The contribution from the ramping power in diminishing system RoCoF during the inception of the perturbation until the critical time was disregarded when \ref{eq:p_at_tcr} was calculated. Assuming an instant switching of the IBFPR at critical time, the frequency nadir would be 49 Hz. Nevertheless, a ramp power response was assumed instead. Therefore the calculated power ramp, when applied to the unbalanced system, commonly exhibits a frequency nadir higher than 49 Hz, due to the contribution of the ramping period. In this sense, it can be inferred that the longer the ramping period, the higher frequency nadir will be obtained. Here again the relevance of the prompt activation in time of the IBFPR. On the other hand, with the faster IBFPR activation, the ramp slope and the steady power output (Inverter based power reserve) can be diminished compromising frequency nadir.\\ %In order to assure stability a stepper ramp slope is required in order to meet the required power before critical time. That is achieved by changing equation 3-2 by the adjusted expression:
%Equation 5 1
%P_IBFPR (t)=∆P*((1-t_cr⁄t_nadir ))/((t_cr-t_d ) )*t
%Where td is the time delay needed to start the activation of IBFPR.
When a comparison is established beween all the calculated power ramp slopes in per unit  (pu), it is noted that with high penetration of non-synchronous power in the power system, the required power to ensure no UFLS have a consistent trend between the three models and a close proximity in the values for RoCoF in the range of 2 to 5 Hz/s is observed between both IEEE models. Such trends can be seen in Figure 5 2. A bigger amount of power ramp slope is needed in all the range of RoCoF for the European case. After inspecting \ref{eq:IBFPR}, it is noticed that the IBFPR is affected by the factor $ 1-t_{cr}⁄t_{nadir} $, then as nadir time increases, IBFPR increases as well. The nadir time for the European case, due to the action of the self-regulation and primary reserve deployment of 30 seconds, is in the range of 3-12 seconds (6 seconds for 80\% IBG penetration) whereas the nadir time for the simplified IEEE model is between 1-3 seconds.\\

\subsubsection{Fast Power Reserve}


The required power ramp  to avoid load shedding has been found for both IEEE 9 bus models with a fast governor response and for the European-scale model  with conventional primary reserve response. Hence, the IBFPR at critical time which remain constant after the critical time, would be accounted as the fast power reserve. %Similarly as primary reserve estimations are performed considering the loss of generation at certain level; for fast power reserve the results are presented for the scenarios in which imbalance could reach even 40\%.

\end{table}

When IBFPR is implemented in all three cases, frequency drop below 49Hz is avoided for all the most of the RoCoF simulated, provided that enough IBFPR is available for the given imbalance. Figures XXX to XXX show how frequency is kept above 49 in all the cases.\\

Insert figures of IBFPR nadir here\\
%For imbalances higher than 3\% the fast power reserve has to cover mostly all the imbalance. The observed offset from the one to one relation is due to the load reduction caused by the frequency drop (load self-regulation). The dashed line represents the one to one proportion. In the case of the IEEE grid; the simplified model exhibits a permanent offset from the dashed line of around 0.05 pu, this due to the action of a faster governor response. Therefore, it can be said that in such scenario, the conventional governor response of synchronous machines would cover 5\% of the imbalances starting at 8\%. Since the values for nadir time are not independent from the imbalance in the Extended model, due to the non-linearity of the model, the calculated power reserve tend to equalize the whole imbalance. As imbalance increases, the critical time decreases and the nadir time increases, this makes the reducing factor tcr/tnadir from Equation 3-2 to decrease and narrows the difference between the calculated reserve and power imbalance.
%Similarly as critical time was presented in Table 5 1 the required fast power reserve in the European context is shown in Table 5 2 for extraordinary events


%As IBG increases the closer to the imbalance the fast power reserve needs to be. As it was demonstrated in the result section; with a faster conventional reserve, reduction in fast power reserve can be observed.

\subsection{Synchronizing effect, lack of damping torque and implications}

The diminishing of synchronous machines leads to a very weak network where synchronizing and damping torque, which are inherent characteristics of synchronous machines, are not enough to stabilize the system[7]. Although the implementation of IBFPR contributes keeping synchronous machine on step, oscillations in the speed/frequency response of the rotor are observed. This oscillations are created by the lack of damping torque which is provided mainly by the synchronous machines through damping windings, rotor field exciter and power system stabilizer[ref]. \\

%Discussion
For the simplified IEEE model and the European island, only transfer functions describing an equivalent system governor were modeled. Hence in such approaches, the effect and dynamics of synchronous generator’s exciters and inter-machine interaction were not taken into account. The before mention factors influence greatly small signal stability [7, 8]
Even though the scoop of this thesis is to analyze the power-time characteristics needed to avoid frequency collapse; oscillations associated to big perturbation were observed but they could not been addressed by the simple injection of power to the system. Also in the IEEE model, when a penetration of 95\% of inverter based generation and 2\% of load imbalance are considered, UFLS is not reached but the system becomes unstable as shown in Figure 5 6 and Figure 5 5. From penetrations levels above 85\% complete frequency stability is not ensure with the injection of fast power reserve, only UFLS on the first 10 seconds approximately. Then the system becomes unstable with increasing amplitude oscillations.
It is important to note that ENTSOE in its EUROPEAN interconnected scenario, determined that there is no UFLS when an unbalance of 2\% with high contribution of non-synchronous generation occurs. Nevertheless, no inter-machine interaction was considered and therefore a similar effect as the one in Figure 5 6 could be experienced.%Discussion
