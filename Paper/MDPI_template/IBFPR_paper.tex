% If you would like to post an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use preprint as the journal and change 'submit' to 'accept'. The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\)
\abstract{Decommissioning of conventional power plants and the installation of inverter-based renewable energy technologies decrease the overall power system's inertia, increasing the rate of change of frequency of the system (RoCoF). These expected high values of RoCoF shorten the time response needed before load shedding or generation curtailment takes place. In a future scenario where renewables are predominant in power systems, the ability of synchronous machines to meet such conditions is uncertain in terms of capacity and time response. The implementation of fast power reserve and synthetic inertia from inverter-based sources was assessed through the simulation of two scenarios with different grid sizes and primary reserve response. As main results it was obtained that full activation time for fast power reserve with penetration above 80\% of inverter-based generation would need to be 100 ms or less for imbalances up to 40\% regardless of the synchronous response and grid size; meaning that current frequency measurement techniques and the time for fast power reserve deployment would not ensure system stability under high unbalanced conditions. At less unbalanced conditions, the grid in the European scale was found to become critical with imbalances starting at 3\% and non-synchronous share of 60\%.}
